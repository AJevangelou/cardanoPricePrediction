## Background

Trying to explore the viability of using RNN, specifically LSTM and GRU models in predicting highly volatile 
cryptocoin prices such as Cardano

## Dataset

Dataset consists of daily prices of Cardano since 2017. The dataset contains the opening, closing, highest and lowest
price on each date as well as the transaction volume. From these data, the opening price for each day is used in this 
analysis.

## Models

- LSTM
- GRU
- Bidirectional LSTM

## Results

MSE of 0.03582 was accomplished with this analysis.

## Dependencies

List the dependencies required to run the code. Include libraries, frameworks, and versions.

## Contributing

Explain how others can contribute to the project. This could include reporting issues, suggesting improvements, or submitting pull requests.
