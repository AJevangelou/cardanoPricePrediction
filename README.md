## Background

Briefly describe the purpose and context of your project. Why are you predicting Cardano prices? What are the potential use cases?

## Dataset

Provide information about the dataset used for training and testing the models. Include details such as data source, features, and any preprocessing steps applied.

## Models

Explain the LSTM and GRU models used for prediction. Include information about the architecture, hyperparameters, and training process.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the code. Include details about data preprocessing, model training, and making predictions. If there are any scripts or notebooks, mention them here.

## Results

Present the results of the predictions. Include metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Visualizations, such as plots comparing predicted and true prices, can be added.

## Dependencies
